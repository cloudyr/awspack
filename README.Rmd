# Amazon Web Services Bundle Package

**awspack** is a bundle of all of [the cloudyr project's](http://cloudyr.github.io) packages for Amazon Web Services (AWS). It depends upon all of the cloudyr project's AWS packages. It is mainly useful for installing the entire suite of packages; more likely than not you will only want to load individual packages one at a time.

To use the package, you will need an AWS account and enter your credentials into R. Your keypair can be generated on the [IAM Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/) under the heading *Access Keys*. Note that you only have access to your secret key once. After it is generated, you need to save it in a secure location. New keypairs can be generated at any time if yours has been lost, stolen, or forgotten. 

By default, all **cloudyr** packages look for the access key ID and secret access key in environment variables. You can also use this to specify a default region or a temporary "session token". For example:

```R
Sys.setenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" = "mykey",
           "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" = "mysecretkey",
           "AWS_DEFAULT_REGION" = "us-east-1",
           "AWS_SESSION_TOKEN" = "mytoken")
```

These can alternatively be set on the command line prior to starting R or via an `Renviron.site` or `.Renviron` file, which are used to set environment variables in R during startup (see `? Startup`).

If you work with multiple AWS accounts, another option that is consistent with other Amazon SDKs is to create [a centralized `~/.aws/credentials` file](https://blogs.aws.amazon.com/security/post/Tx3D6U6WSFGOK2H/A-New-and-Standardized-Way-to-Manage-Credentials-in-the-AWS-SDKs), containing credentials for multiple accounts. You can then use credentials from this file on-the-fly by simply doing:

```R
# use your 'default' account credentials
aws.signature::use_credentials()

# use an alternative credentials profile
aws.signature::use_credentials(profile = "bob")
```

Temporary session tokens are stored in environment variable `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (and will be stored there by the `use_credentials()` function). The [aws.iam package](https://github.com/cloudyr/aws.iam/) provides an R interface to IAM roles and the generation of temporary session tokens via the security token service (STS).

## Installation

This package is not yet on CRAN. To install the latest development version you can install from the cloudyr drat repository:

```R
# latest stable version
install.packages("awspack", repos = c(cloudyr = "http://cloudyr.github.io/drat", getOption("repos")))
```

Or, to pull a potentially unstable version directly from GitHub:

```R
if (!require("ghit")) {
    install.packages("ghit")
}
ghit::install_github("cloudyr/awspack")
```
