# Amazon Web Services Bundle Package #

**awspack** is a bundle of all of [the cloudyr project's](http://cloudyr.github.io) packages for Amazon Web Services (AWS). It imports all functions from all of the AWS packages into its own namespace and exports them. If you only want functions from a specific package, load the individual package instead.
