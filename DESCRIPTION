Description: A bundle of all of 'cloudyr' project <http://cloudyr.github.io/> packages for Amazon Web Services ('AWS') <https://aws.amazon.com/>. It depends upon all of the 'cloudyr' project's 'AWS' packages. It is mainly useful for installing the entire suite of packages; more likely than not you will only want to load individual packages one at a time.
